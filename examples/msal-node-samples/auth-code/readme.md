## ews-javascript-api with @azure/msal-node
you will be redirected for authentication
you need `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from azure app registration.

azure app must have `api permission` added for `EWS.AccessAsUser.All`

# MSAL Node Standalone Sample:  Auth Code

The sample applications contained in this directory are independent samples of MSAL Node usage, covering each of the authorization flows that MSAL Node currently supports. To get started with this sample, first follow the general instructions [here](../readme.me).

Once MSAL Node is installed, and you have the right files, come here to learn about this scenario.

### How is this scenario used?
The Auth Code flow is most commonly used for a web app that signs in users.  General information about this scenario is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-web-app-sign-user-overview?tabs=aspnetcore).

## Test the Sample

### Configure the application
Open the `index.js` file.

Find the `config` object.  We will change this to add details about our app registration and deployment.

By default, this configuration is set to support all Microsoft accounts. This includes Azure AD accounts used by organizations, and MSA accounts typically used by consumers. 

Before proceeding, go to the Azure portal, and open the app registration for this app.

#### **Client ID**
Within the "Overview" you will see a GUID labeled **Application (client) ID**.  Copy this GUID to the clientId field in the config.

Click the **Authentication** link in the left nav.

#### **Authority**
Check that supported account types are: **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**

If so, then leave the default setting for authority as `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`

For other supported account types, review the other [Authority options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-application-configuration).  Unless there is a specific need to restrict users of your app to an organization, we strongly suggest that everyone use the default authority.  User restrictions can be placed later in the application flow if needed.

#### **Client Secret**

This secret helps prevent third parties from using your app registration.
Click on `Certificates and Secrets` in the left nav.
Click `New Client Secret` and pick an expiry.
Click the `Copy to Clipboard` icon, and add the secret to the config object in index.js.

ðŸŽ‰You have finished the basic configuration!ðŸŽ‰

### Executing the application

From the command line, let npm install any needed dependencies.  This only needs to be done once.

```bash
$ npm install
```
1. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the sample application by using the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port number specified) with the browser of your choice.

### Customizing the application

To customize the start script, review the `package.json` file.

## Adding this scenario to an existing application

### Import the Configuration Object

If you set up the sample with your app registration, you may be able to copy this object directly into your application.  


```js
const config = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "12d77c73-d09d-406a-ae0d-3d4e576f7d9b",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
        clientSecret: ""
    },
Â Â Â Â system:Â {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â loggerOptions:Â {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â loggerCallback(loglevel,Â message,Â containsPii)Â {
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â console.log(message);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â },
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     piiLoggingEnabled: false,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     logLevel:Â msal.LogLevel.Verbose,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â }
Â Â Â Â }
};
```

### Configure Dependencies

Add the dependency on MSAL Node to your Node app.

```js
const msal = require('@azure/msal-node');
```

### Initialize MSAL Node at runtime


Initialize the app object within your web app.

```js
const cca = new msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(config);
```

### Configure Sign In Request

Choose the route that requires sign in.  Within that route, set up permissions, and direct the MSAL Node app object to attempt sign in.

In our sample, we immediately sign in the user.  If you want all users to be logged in before they view anything, then you can use the same process.
We add our sign in code to the default route. 

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
```

Next, we have to pick the `scopes` related to the user.  If we are logging in a user, then we must at least request access to basic user information.  The default scope of `user.read` grants that basic access.  To learn more see the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).

```js
    const authCodeUrlParameters = {
        scopes: ["user.read"],
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/redirect",
    };
```

The ```redirectUri``` is the return route.  After logging in a user, they will hit this route.  Your application logic will take over here.  You will want to customize the redirectUri for your application.

Next we direct the user to authenticate.  The following code block directs the user based on the Authority we set in the config, and directs the user as needed.

```js
    pca.getAuthCodeUrl(authCodeUrlParameters).then((response) => {
        res.redirect(response);
    }).catch((error) => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)));
```

Putting together the routing and all the logic for starting the sign in yields the following code:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const authCodeUrlParameters = {
        scopes: ["user.read"],
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/redirect",
    };

    cca.getAuthCodeUrl(authCodeUrlParameters).then((response) => {
        res.redirect(response);
    }).catch((error) => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)));
});
```
### Configure Sign In Response

The next step occurs after the redirect.
Your application must first *complete* the sign in flow by processing the code and validating the incoming request.

First, configure the route where you will receive the response.  This must match your application configuration on the Azure portal.

```js
app.get('/redirect', (req, res) => {
```

Next,  your app logic will validate the scopes and route.  These settings must match the request.  Make sure the `scopes` match the request. Make sure the `redirectUri` matches the app registration, and the route.

```js
    const tokenRequest = {
        code: req.query.code,
        scopes: ["user.read"],
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/redirect",
    };
```
The above code is the *configuration* for validating the response.  The following code validates the response and completes the sign in.

```js
    pca.acquireTokenByCode(tokenRequest).then((response) => {
        console.log("\nResponse: \n:", response);
        res.sendStatus(200);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
        res.status(500).send(error);
    });
```
Putting together the routing and all the logic for completing the sign in yields the following code:

```js
app.get('/redirect', (req, res) => {
    const tokenRequest = {
        code: req.query.code,
        scopes: ["user.read"],
        redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/redirect",
    };

    cca.acquireTokenByCode(tokenRequest).then((response) => {
        console.log("\nResponse: \n:", response);
        res.sendStatus(200);
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
        res.status(500).send(error);
    });
});
```

### The User Experience

What happens if the user logs in, closes the window, returns to the site, and logs in again?  Microsoft supports many, many complex scenarios with many, many forms of authentication: certificates, hardware keys, federated experiences, and even biometrics in some cases.  Let our library handle the complexity of deciding the simplest way of logging in the user.

Silent flows are not used with the this scenario. See [Authentication Flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows) for a discussion of the interaction between flows.
